# Arduino stuff

### What is this repository ?

I'll be saving some useful __Arduino__ (and possibly __Atmel__) code here.

Here's a current list of projects:
* [EEPROM_STUFF](EEPROM) - A lightweight code for saving data in EEPROM. Or jump directly to the [source code](EEPROM/EEPROM_STUFF/EEPROM_STUFF.ino)
